I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Stevens Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Yu Gan. I earned my M.S. in Computer Engineering from UC San Diego in 2022. My research focuses on deep learning, generative models, and large language models for medical imaging and report generation. Specifically, I work on developing advanced deep learning techniques to improve medical image segmentation, synthetic image generation, and automated medical report generation. My goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making through cutting-edge AI methodologies.
- I am actively looking for an internship position in summer 2025.
